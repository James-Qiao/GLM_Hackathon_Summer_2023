## Part 1: Overview

This is a repository for part of my work during the summer research internship 2023, supervised by Prof. Huang Yuanhua from the School of Biomedical Sciences, HKU. 

During the first one month and a half, I learned [foundamental data science skills][1] and read some materials on machine learning[^1][^2]. I have built a logistic regression model from scratch by implementing gradient descent, and a negative binomial regression model which fits the parameters $\beta$ and dispersion factor $\phi$ by using the [optimize function by statsmodels][2].

Additionally, I used my models to analyze some public datasets and got decent results, which are introduced in detail in [Part 2: File documentations](#part-2-file-documentations).

Meanwhile, I learned the basic procedures of scRNA-seq analysis and got familiar with some important tools such as docker and [scanpy][3]. As a small project, I used scanpy to cluster and find marker genes to annotate a public dataset and compared with the author's results, which aligned relatively well.
